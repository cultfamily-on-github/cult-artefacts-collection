# CULT Artefacts Collection

This repository is meant to collect and preserve artefacts of a movement which is already CULT.   
The plan is that the [cultmagazine.org](https://cultmagazine.org/) will be able one day to automatically display the artefacts which are stored here.   

## Contribute
Everyone is invited to contribute. If you want to contribute but do not fully get how [pull requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lGpZkjnkt4) work yet, you can also just [submit an issue](https://github.com/michael-spengler/cult-artefacts-collection/issues) and attach the meme, image, pdf or whatever you would like to upload.

## Regular Uploads to IPFS
This is under construction.  
I guess many of us are running an [ipfs.io](https://ipfs.io) node. 
I can imagine that we have regular automated synch runs where the content of this repo's folder is uploaded to ipfs - and pinned - at least until the next upload run is completed.
