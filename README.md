## Regular Uploads to IPFS
This is under construction.  
I guess many of us are running an [ipfs.io](https://ipfs.io) node. 
I can imagine that we have regular automated synch runs where the content of this repo's folder is uploaded to ipfs - and pinned - at least until the next upload run is completed.
